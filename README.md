# TextMiningandSentimentAnalysis
Used Harvard IV, Lexicon, AFINN dictionaries to perform sentiment analysis of Yelp restaurant user-reviews.

Used the “bag of word” approach for text mining and creating the document-term matrix using the term occurrences, binary term presence/absence values, or TF-IDF text vecorization.

Developed Machine Learning models using SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes to predict review sentiment.
